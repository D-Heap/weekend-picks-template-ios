# MapBox Weekend Picks Template (iOS Edition)

This is the native iOS app to compliment the MapBox markers example: 

 * Site: http://mapbox.com/map-sites/weekend-picks/
 * Repo: https://github.com/mapbox/weekend-picks-template

This is a native iOS app with similar functionality. Once you've got a map with markers on it, just configure the following in `MBWPViewController.m`: 

 * `kTileJSONURL`: URL to your map on MapBox
 * `kTintColorHex`: HTML/CSS-style color hex code to match theming with your site

Then, just build & run the app and explore your picks!
